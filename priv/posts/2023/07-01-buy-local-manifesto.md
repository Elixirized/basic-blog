# **THAT WAS THEN** (TODO: Set Header Styles)
<br/>

"**Buy Local!**" You have probably heard that term--certainly in the US, and probably in Europe and other places.
<br/>
As Amazon was accelerating its reach during the early 2000's, "buy local" struck me as an empty phrase. The local shopping experience was typically not very enjoyable. Prices were way higher locally, and the in-store experience could be soul-crushing. Indifferent and untrained store clerks, inaccurate inventory and the iffy condition of that in-store merchandise made it truly painful to "buy local."
<br/>

The national bookstore chains were the most obvious example of this. Remember Borders? Crown? Waldenbooks? Tower? I remember vividly that using Amazon (which happened to choose books as their initial market) made it obvious that bookseller giant Borders was a walking-dead operation, and Borders went into bankruptcy in 2006, finally closing all stores (including its Waldenbooks stores that were in hundreds of US shopping malls) in 2011. 
<br/>
Smaller Tower Records & Books lasted until 2006, but troubled Crown Bookstores failed in 2001. A few other national and regional chains--along with many small independent bookstores--also went out of business during that time, and that trend unfortunately continues today. [_FOOTNOTE_: Barnes & Noble is the remaining national bookstore chain, but I don't know why they have survived. My experiences there still make me reach for my Amazon app.]
<br/>

I remember thinking "I am a little troubled that Borders went away--Tower, Waldenbooks & Crown too--but the Amazon experience is actually better, and so are their prices--by a LOT." I was also saddened by the hit that independent bookstores and their local communities were taking, but I reluctantly overlooked that as the collateral damage from "progress".
<br/>
# **IN THE MEANTIME**
<br/>
The decimation of local businesses--retailers in particular--started a few years earlier by big-box stores (including Walmart) mushroomed, fueled by Amazon's momentum as shoppers like me surrendered the positive social interactions available from shopping in our communities for the convenience and efficiency of online for many things, and defaulting to the numbing experience in big-box stores for the rest. Dozens of national retail chains went out of business, along with hundreds of locally-owned retailers. Business all have lifecycles, and no business lasts forever, but this was way beyond "the circle of [business] life."
